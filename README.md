# User Story

## What’s for dinner

User first sees a home page with a title “What’s for dinner?”.  There is an image and a description of the functionality of the app along with directions to either login or register.  A navigation bar is at the top of the page with login and register links.  If the user is returning to the the site, they click on the login link to take them to a login page. Otherwise, the user clicks on the register link to take them to a register form.  Once they are logged in, they see two options. First option is a button that says “what’s for dinner”  the other is a button that says “add a meal”  if the user clicks what’s for dinner, a show page appears featuring  a randomly selected dinner and ingredients for that dinner.  The user can then click a random dinner button for a different dinner or click a button that takes them to an index page showing all of the available dinner options.  

# With this app, the user can:
Add, update, and destroy meals and ingredients in a sql database
See all of the meals
See all of the ingredients for all of the meals
See the ingredients for just one selected meal
See a random meal and its ingredients

# M.V.P. 
a useful app for times when a user is too busy to plan dinner and wants to see a random meal, ingredients and link to a recipe.

# Possible Future developments
allow the user to select meals based on ingredients that they have, or add a calendar feature to plan more meals for different days.
