## Whatâ€™s For Dinner

### A full-stack two-model C.R.U.D. app built with Ruby and Sinatra

#### User Story
User can:
login or register
add, edit and delete meals in a database
see a list of meals
see a list of ingredients for all of the meals
see the ingredients for one meal
add edit and delete ingredients in a database
see a random meal and its ingredients

#### M.V.P. 
a useful app for times when a user is too busy to plan dinner and wants to see a random meal, ingredients and link to a recipe.

#### Possible Future developments
allow the user to select meals based on ingredients that they have, or add a calendar feature to plan more meals for different days.
